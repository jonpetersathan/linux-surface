Subject: [PATCH] Input: soc_button_array - support AMD variant Surface devices

The power button on the AMD variant of the Surface Laptop uses the
same MSHW0040 device ID as the 5th and later generation of Surface
devices, however they report 0 for their OEM platform revision.  As the
_DSM does not exist on the devices requiring special casing, check for
the existance of the _DSM to determine if soc_button_array should be
loaded.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: surfacepro3_button: don't load on amd
 variant

The AMD variant of the Surface Laptop report 0 for their OEM platform
revision.  The Surface devices that require the surfacepro3_button
driver do not have the _DSM that gets the OEM platform revision.  If the
method does not exist, load surfacepro3_button.

Subject: [PATCH] input/misc/soc-button-array: Fix wakeup from suspend not
 working

On some Surface devices (Surface Laptop 5 and Surface Pro 9) a race
condition between the soc_button_array and pinctrl_icelake/tigerlake
can lead to ACPI tables not being loaded correctly. In particular,
if MSHW0040 is probed before the pinctrl module is loaded, the
wakeup sources for the power button are not added, making the device
unable to wake up from a suspended state when pressing the power
button.

This adds a soft dependency to the soc_button_array, ensuring it is
loaded after pinctrl_icelake or pinctrl_tigerlake module.

Tested on Surface Laptop 5. After the fix the device can be woken up
reliably from a suspended state.
